# MNIST Digit Recognition 
Project for my univeristy Machine Learning Algorithms course
## Objectives
Create a multi-layer perceptron that can recognize written digits
## Modules to implement
- [x] MLP
- [x] Digit drawing
- [x] Reading input from local file
- [x] Saving calculated weights and biases to a file (to skip future training)
- [x] Confusion matrix

Model trained on 10000 epochs, with a 0.1 training rate. Model accuracy: 97.13%.
